# How too contribute

Contributions it's the most important things for us!!

We are a community and without your help and the help of the contributors we cannot do nothing :)

So first of all: THANK YOU!

If you want to contribute to this repository please check this requirements before:

- Have poetry and python installed: check the `pyproject.toml` to find the right versions used in this project
- You can install and use also `pdm`, it's configured but not officially supported in this repository
- Have `makefile` or `just` installed. We suggest to use `just` because it's more modern and easily to install also on windows.
