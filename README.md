# Python Biella Group: Bear

This project it's the base template for a Python project that we are using in PythonBiellaGroup to create our tools, libraries and projects.

We call it **Bear** because it's a **B**ase **E**nvironment for **A**ny **R**easonable project and also because the bear it's the symbol of the city of Biella.

It's based on **Modern Python Tools** such as:
- cookiecutter: for templating
- poetry: for dependency management
- pdm: for dependency management
- flake8: for linting
- mypy: for static type checking
- black: for code formatting
- bandit: for security checks
- pre-commit: for pre-commit hooks
- pdm: for linting

We suggest to use **VSCode** as IDE for this project since you can find a lot of prepared configurations for:
- debugging
- testing
- settings
- extensions

You can find and extensive documentation created with **mkdocs** to [this github page link](https://pythonbiellagroup.github.io/bear/)
